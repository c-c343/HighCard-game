Simple Card game written in C#

Game overview:
  Each player is created at the start of the game
  After game overview menu is displayed, a request for a 
  user input will be sent.
  User must enter 'Y' if they would like to start the game or 
  'N' if they would like to exit. 
  
  Once the game begins, a random generator is used to deal a card to each player.
  The winner will be determined by the card rank. If both players get the same rank,
  the suit of their card will determine a winner.
  
  The game will request a user input again if the player would like to continue playing.
  Once user enters 'N', the game will terminate.
